"""
Write a Python script that takes your GitHub credentials
(username and password) and uses the GitHub API to display your id

Requirements:
    - You must use Basic Authentication with a personal access token
      as password to access to your information
      (only read:user permission is needed)
    - The first argument will be your username
    - The second argument will be your password
      (in your case, a personal access token as password)
    - You must use the package requests and sys
    - You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
    - You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
