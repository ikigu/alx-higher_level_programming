Matrix is not list
::
    >>> matrix = "foo"
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Matrix is not a list of lists
::
    >>> matrix = [2]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


Matrix contains non-numbers
::
    >>> matrix = [[1, "b", 4.5]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Matrix rows are not similar size
::
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

div is not a number
::
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, "foo")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: div must be a number


div is 0
::
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Correct use case
::
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
